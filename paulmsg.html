<p style="color:white">Wow, you found me!
    <br> Don't worry about me. I intentionally dissappeared to give you this fun programming assignment.
    <br> I hope you've enjoyed this project:)
</p>

<p style="color:white">
    By the way, I want to give you a small reward for finding me using your decipher program.
    <br> Please take a screenshot of this page and submit it on Blackboard with your decipher.py.
    <br> What it means is that you will upload two files on Blackboard. (decipher.py & Screenshot of this page)
    <br> Then, you will earn 5 points more as bonus points on Homework 4.
